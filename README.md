## Architecture

If you want to modify the styling, add pages, ... here is the architecture of the project (this file might change with time !).

```
.next/          # Don't touch it
components/     # Contains components
    layout.js       # Layout of all pages (header, footer, title, ...)
    writeup.js      # Component used to render the markdown files to html
helpers/        # Contains all nodejs helpers functions
    md.js           # Contains all function to read/retreive markdown files
node_modules/   # Don't touch it
pages/          # Folder containing all the pages (also used for routing of tha application)
    write-ups/      # Jvais pas tout expliquer non plus
        [category]/     # Anything on the url `website.com/write-ups/[category]`, (available paths in getStaticProps of index)
            [slug].js       # Same as for category, but here, for an article
            index.js        # home page for a category
        index.js        # home page for /write-ups
    _app.js         # Better not to touch it
    404.js          # Rendered page for a not found url
    index.js        # Home page of the website
    whoami.js       # website.fr/whoami page
posts/          # Folder containing all your markdown posts
    category/       # Each category is represented as a folder
        post.md         # each post with the previously described structure
public/         # Folder containing accessible files from any url. Here is a proposed structure but you can make your own (be carefull with script)
    assets/         # Used to keep any type of files
    images/         # Used for images
    script/         # In an ideal world you should not use script here but do everything with next
    favicon.ico     # Your favicon
styles/         # Folder used by nextjs for styling (we use it wrong)
    globals.css         # Used to for styling of pretty much all the website
    writeups.module.css # Used for styling the write up articles 
    wu.css              # I don't even know myself
The rest/               # Try not to touch it unless you know what you do
```
